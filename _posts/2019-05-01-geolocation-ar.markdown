### Motivation

To develop a fully functional Augmented Reality based Location Assistant.


### Work

Planning and developing an AR based Location Assistant Application. Location and orientation is tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Intertial sensors (Gyroscope, Linear Accelerometer). Both World Stabilized and Screen Stabilized 3D objects are augmented for information about the location. Also mentoring a freshman as part of the Open Source initiative of Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

### Under Development

This project is currently under development.

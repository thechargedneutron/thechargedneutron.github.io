## Summary:

My first blog post was for the first two weeks. In this blog I try to list down my adventures in the next two weeks of my stay in Japan.

### <span style="color:red">FujiQ Highlands (Saturday, Week 3)</span>

Situated at the footsteps of Mt. Fuji, this amusement park offers intense thrill and screams. The rides here are probably the best one can get in a single day. The "screamer" rides pretty much lives up to their name. The roller coasters take you through all the ups and downs possible.

I, along with a big group of six more friends, reached FujiQ Highland at 8.55 am, a whisker shy of the opening time of 9 am. Since there's a long line for each important ride, and that we went there on a Saturday, some of us bought Fast Passes which would give priority entry with no waiting time. I bought Fast Pass for three out of four celebrated rides. The entry time of the fast pass rides were deliberately spread into two hours in order to have some time in between. We followed the order as written below and would advice the same order to anyone, since the earlier ones are a bit on the easier side. 

#### Do-Dodonpa

This ride is famous for its high speed start. It achieves a whopping speed of 180 kmph in just 1.56s. The ride starts with a countdown in the background and whoa! we are crusing at 180 kmph. Further sharp turns and twists awaits us just the speed goes down a bit. The duration of the ride was less but still manager to cover 1.244km in this time.

#### Takabisha

Another screamer, this ride is known for it's vertical ascent followed by 121 degree straight descent. Again in this ride, there was a fast start, indicating the level of difficulty. The ride made a slow ascent of about 50 metres - this was the scariest part. My torso was parallel to ground and I was going straight up, and that too at a very slow speed. As soon as the ride reached the top, it began a descent, followed by a series of turns and twists. We seriously needed some rest after these two truely adventurous rides.

#### Eejanaika

Eejanaika is called as the four dimension ride - famous for the degree of freedom it offers. I would rate this as the best ride of the park. This ride has all kinds of movements, including movement about oneself. The best part of this ride is that this ride starts backwards. And soon the ride makes us move in all kinds possible, including flipping around our own seat. Also the track of this ride has all kinds of turns which make it even more exciting.

#### Other Rides

Apart from these four important rides, we had a lot of other relaxing rides and fun activites. The Splash ride was pretty relaxing in which the ride went straight into the water thus creating a big splash. Apart from that there was another fun water ride which made us go round a track full of water - occasionally spilling onto us. The "Tentekomai" ride took us to a great height. Mt Fuji was visible from that high and I enjoyed the cool breeze up there. There were a couple of more fun rides including Mad Mouse, Boating and the Cup Ride - all were relaxing and fun.

We returned to our respective residence in the Highway bus we had bought tickets for. We all were very exhausted after a truly adventourous day.



### <span style="color:red">Odaiba - High-Tech Entertainment Hub (Sunday, Week 3)</span>

Visiting Teamlabs was the prime motivation to spend a day in Odaiba - the high-tech entertainment hub of Tokyo.

#### Toyota Mega Web

Visiting this grand Toyota Showroom was never in the predecided to-do list, but as soon as the stylish Cars caught our eyes en-route to Teamlabs, we decided to spend some time here. There were verious models on display. Not only cars but also other products Toyota is focussing at. We saw some really cool vehicles including a self balancing one wheeled vehicle. There was a driving simulator at display with free test drive. It had good feedback mechanism and nice interface, but the controls were not good and unrealistic. Spending half an hour on this simulator was definitely not worth it. :(

#### Teamlabs - Borderless

Teamlabs is a very famous Digital Art Show with tones of LEDs and light effects into place. I was pretty impressed by their concept. They call their art "Borderless" - having no boundaries, and hence, they do not provide a fixed map of the place. It is upon the visitor to explore the art works all around. We spent a very good three hours in this excellent digital art center. The place is divided into variety of arts, some of them I'll touch upon here.

Good walk along the bay


### <span style="color:red">Akihabara (Saturday, Week 4)</span>

### <span style="color:red">Shinjuku (Sunday, Week 4)</span>

The glamourous Tokyo Tower is situated just along the roadside, at the center of a busy road intersection. This giant tower is very pleasing to look at with tiny looking elevators taking people to heights. Tokyo Tower was built much before the Skytree. Although I must agree that Skytree was better in terms of both view and height, credits must be given to Tokyo Tower for being much older than the Skytree. After Tokyo Tower, we set out on a walk to reach Rainbow Bridge.

#### Rainbow Bridge

Unplanned trips are not always fun. This time it backfired severely. With Google navigation not being supportive, we ended up searching for the bridge for a long time. We were able to see the giant Skytree but wasted a lot of time trying to get there. We walked for a total of more than one hour right from the Tokyo Tower. In the end, we came to know that the time to walk on the rainbow bridge ended at 9pm. Then, I came up with a hilarious but innovative idea of crossing the bridge in train and coming back from the same station - thus having the same view without paying anything. We settled with this plan and saw the beautiful rainbow bridge as well as the view from it.

### <span style="color:red">Kamakura - Political center of Medieval Japan (Saturday, Week 2)</span>

On the recommendations of my colleagues at office, I was convinced that Kamakura is an eligible place for a one day excursion. Kamakura was the capital of Japan in the twelfth century. It is home to peaceful shrines and the famous Buddha statue. I was very lucky to have got [this link](https://trulytokyo.com/kamakura-day-trip-itinerary/) of one day itinerary to Kamakura. We followed this itinerary and had a very smooth and memorable trip.

#### Tsurugaoka Hachimangū 

This is the most important shrine in the city. None of the structure in the town is allowed to be higher than this shrine. Located at a walking distance from the Kamakura station, this place is very peaceful despite having a large number of visitors from all over the world. We witnessed a Japanese wedding at this venue. There's also a museum inside the shrine which has details and objects from medieval period. The street leading towards the shrine is a shopping street with the same medival setting.

#### Myohonji

Myohonji is a little far from the activities of the town. Walking to Myohonji was fun in itself. The town planning and roads are very different from Tokyo, thus making it a good place to take a break. Myohonji occuies a big area with good view. We spotted a few newly wed couples coming to get their wedding photoshoot done. We saw many artists enjoying the peace of the temple and busy with their canvas.

#### Hasedara Temple

Another 15 minute walk took us to Hasedara Temple, a beautiful temple on the hills of Kamakura. The temple has both good decoration and good natural beauty. The Prospect Road is a short walk to the top of the hill and back down. Whole of the Kamakura town is visible from the hill. Since the sun is on the other side of the hill, the temperature is very good and walking aroung the temple complex will be relaxing. There are Bamboo plants all around and fishes in clean water. Definitely the best view of the day.

#### Kotkuji Temple

We headed towards the final destination of the itinerary, Kotkuji Temple, famous for the giant Buddha statue. It was fun having all kinds of photographs with the giant Buddha statue. The Buddha status is big and stands unaltered despite being only 10m above the sea level.

#### Kamakura Beach

The day ended with a walk to the beach. The cold breeze at the beach and the view of the sunset made the end really great.

### <span style="color:red">Harajuku - the youth centre of Tokyo (Sunday, Week 2)</span>

#### Yoyogi Park

The appearance of the Yoyogi park made it look like just another park. But I was impressed with the flora in the park. There were all kinds of roses, of all colors, with strong smell. It was exciting to flaunt my expertise in DSLR, by taking photos of roses and sunflowers. There were more than fifty groups of people having picnic - singing out loudly, dancing, laughing and relaxing. It had a very lively atmosphere.

#### Takeshita Street

Later in the eveing, most of the time was spent window shopping in the famous Takeshita Street. It was surprising that most of the shops in the street got closed at 8pm, thus putting a premature end to a fun filled weekend.

As I spend more time in this country, I will keep pushing myself to keep updating the blog.

## Introduction

Research and Development Project done under Prof Amit Sethi, IIT Bombay.

## The Work

Developed an algorithm to visualize the parts of image influencing a decision in a CNN architecture. Deployed the algorithm to Breast Cancer Dataset and obtained the activation regions in Benign, In-Situ, Normal and Invasive tissues and analyzed the various regions of interest. Generated Heatmaps of localization in tissues and investigated hidden features across four classes. Performed the localization task both on patches as well as on whole tissue images.

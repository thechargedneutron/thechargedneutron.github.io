## Introduction

This project was done as a part of the Microprocessors course at IIT Bombay. The microprocessor design was done for both multi-cylce and pipleined architecture. The theory required for the project was taught alongisde during 5th Semester in my undergraduate course by Prof Virendra Singh, IIT Bombay.

### Motivation

To develop a fully functional Augmented Reality based Chess game application.


### Work

Developing an Android Augmented Reality based Chess Game Application. Also mentoring a freshman as part of the Open Source Initiative of Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay. Designing the 3D models of Game Elements in Blender - a 3D modelling tool. Using Vuforia AR-SDK in Unity Editor for the gameplay to achieve the animation and gameplay.

### Update

I pitched this idea in one of my talks at IIT Bombay and the project was later taken up and completed by [Rishi Vanukuru](https://rishivanukuru.com/) on his own.

This project can be seen [here](https://rishivanukuru.com/projects/artwo/). Please note that this awesome work is done entirely by him.

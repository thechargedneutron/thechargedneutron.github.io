### Motivation

This work is primarily motivated by my previous experiments with mobile-based Augmented Reality. I have done several AR projects previously. I observed that the performance of AR applications is dependent on the hardware being used. Naturally, it is crucial to understand and compare the hardwares involved in building AR systems. Also, the accuracy and precision is important in considering the feasibility for an application. For example, if the mobile device has an error of 10 meters in calculating its position, the device cannot be used for very fine AR application. If such applications are made, they will be hegely errenous. Two important hardwares are considered in this work - the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Battery. Both are described briefly in the flowwing sections.

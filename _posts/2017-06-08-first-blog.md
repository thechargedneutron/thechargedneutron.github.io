Hello Dear,

This is my first blog. My curiosity to explore Jekyll pages instigated me to make a webpage of my own and host it on my Github profile. I would recommend all the readers to give it a try and make your own personal page. Please let me know if you find this blog attractive. 

There are tons of feature that I can try out writing on this blog. Let's try out some!!

Okay! Here goes a code snipet:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
cout<<"Hello World!!"<<endl;
return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try including a quote:

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello All, this is an awesome style to write great quotes by great individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

Here's the song that is cool enough to be on my first blog:

<br>
<strong>These</strong> <del>are</del> <code>the</code> <kbd>various</kbd> <samp>ways</samp> <em>in</em> which <mark>I</mark> <sup>can</sup> <u>highlight</u> <sub>words</sub>.

<br>
<br>
So enough of experiments, signing off.


Cheers,

Kumar Ashutosh

<p>Hello All! I'm currently a Senior Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Throughout my stay in the campus, I have strived to explore as many dimensions as possible. I made numerous friends and lost a few as well. I went to places all around the 'City of Dreams'. Also, blessed to have experienced Singapore and Japan during my sophomore and junior years, respectively. I have actively participated in various activities in the institute. I always keep myself engrossed in activites that interests me.</p>

<p>I am extremely fascinated by Augmented Reality and its potential to transform the world around us. I have been trying to explore this area of research and development. Apart from this, I am also keen to explore more of Computer Architecture, Computer Vision and Signal Processing. I have always felt that inter-disciplanary research will lead us to marvellous technical innovations. As a part of my curriculum, I have acquired various technical skills and knowledge with great practical potential. On similar lines, I have applied these understanding of the subjects in my internships.</p>
